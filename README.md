RestfulPolicy

A practice in using Spring Boot and Java to create a RESTful CrUD mircoservice, backed by an in-memory H2 database.

Research through many sites including DZone: https://dzone.com/ specifically java and microservices
And
Book: "Microservices for Java Developers: A Hands-on Introduction to Frameworks and Containers" from Red Hat
Primary instruction following youtube series by Telusko Learnings: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7oA8QOlMtQsRT_I7Rx2hoX4
Built using Spring Tool Suite: https://spring.io/tools/sts
API calls made using Postman: https://www.getpostman.com/

Outstanding issues/ room for improvement:
-fields for startDate and endDate should implement Date type instead of string
-project in currently in an MVC format for review/ entire project can implement SpringDataRest which removes the need for a controller class. I have decided to not implement that stage so that I can review the project
